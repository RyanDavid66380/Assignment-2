    <p class="r3-text-grey">The duration of this course is 4 years and I want to aim the best possible outcome that I can achieve. In the third year I would be involved in a placement year hopefully with Amazon where I would get a chance show off my skills. I have worked in a restaurant in Piccadilly, Manchester. Where I was involved in serving the customers to the restaurants rating. I achieved this by being a good interactive waiter and attaining good feedback towards the restaurant. Even though I would prefer working in an environment related to my studies I would like to continue working in a customer interactive environment.</p>
